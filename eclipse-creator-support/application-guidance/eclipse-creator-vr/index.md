Eclipse Creator is a mixed-reality app for the delivery of hands-on technical laboratory training. Following the creation of SOPs/protocols using the desktop app, Eclipse Creator can be loaded in headset and both the instructional content and objects overlaid onto a real-world environment. This will guide trainees through protocols whilst allowing minimally restricted interaction with devices, equipment and consumables. Below is a short tutorial video to help get you started:

## Feature Notes

**Boundary**: Player boundaries must be created in the VR headset and refers to a safe area in which Eclipse Creator can be experienced. The headset should request that this is set prior to launching the application.

**Space Orientation**: Users can use the reorientate function to set the center of their play space and adjust their orientation.

**Dispensers**:  Single-use consumables and boxes of pipettes/vials come in the form of a boxed dispenser. This means that they hold indefinite numbers of that asset. The assets can be accessed by either pinching or grabbing at the box.
