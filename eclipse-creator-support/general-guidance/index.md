# General Guidance

Eclipse Creator is a training software and **mixed reality** platform that empowers teams to deliver standardized hands-on technical training from standard operating procedures (**SOPs**) or teaching modules. Using the Eclipse Creator desktop app, instructors can copy and paste or create customized SOPs/modules for distribution across multiple headsets. The application then allows users to choose from the extensive library of equipment, devices and consumables to construct an immersive laboratory space equipped to perform training. The immersive mixed reality training modules will then be wirelessly uploaded to your synced Eclipse Creator VR experience. Here the SOP library can be accessed and protocols performed consistently across multiple headsets by trainees under the supervision of instructors. Instructors can also choose to monitor progress from the desktop via casting or review in-headset recordings for post-performance assessment. 

Eclipse Creator goes beyond traditional tutorial learning, offering users a level of interaction that mirrors real-life laboratory conditions. While it's not a full real-life simulation, it provides enough flexibility for users to work with devices as they would in an actual lab setting. This enhanced realism helps users build confidence, develop a deep understanding of instrument functionality and practice proper laboratory techniques. With the platform, users can design experiments, create laboratory workflows and improve their retention of applied knowledge from textbooks and SOPs - all before transitioning to the physical lab environment. 

The scope of Eclipse Creator and its contents are ever expanding and so updating of the software will often be required. We also understand that our customers requirement may differ or change over time. For this purpose it is important to us that any feedback or requests are relayed to our admin account:
