# Equipment & Hardware Set Up.

**Device applicability**

- FourPlus currently offers 3 applications to be experienced on VR and PC. All are currently compatible with Meta Quest 2, 3 and Pro headsets (Meta Quest 2 + devices). 
- Proteus is a free application so does not require payment or a license to access. 
- For additional guidance installing paid, licensed applications Accelerate and Eclipse Creator to headset click [here](../installation-of-eclipse-creator-vr/index.md). 
- For additional guidance installing paid, licensed application Eclipse SOP Creator desktop app (coupled with Eclipse Creator VR app) click [here](../installation-of-eclipse-creator-desktop/index.md).

## FourPlus on Meta Quest

The current preferential platform for the installation of FourPlus software is using the Meta Horizon Store and downloading to applicable Quest headsets. The installation guidance here will therefore refer solely to installation using this platform. 

## VR fleet management systems

Although downloading through the Meta Store is ideal for individual headsets and possible for small collections of headsets, users will require a unique account per headset to play the app simultaneously. ArborXR is an alternative for those who wish to install and experience the app on many headsets simultaneously, without using unique accounts.

- Using an MDM like Arbor XR allows you to install both Accelerate and Eclipse Creator VR app (and any other ones you may be using) remotely on a collection of devices. If you choose to use Arbor XR and would like to be added to the FourPlus license distribution list, please contact sales for further details. 
- For further assistance using Arbor XR, visit their help centre

*Note: When downloading Eclipse Creator from the Meta Horizon app store and installing to multiple headsets, users should be aware that multiple emails and linked accounts will be required for this (1 per headset). Therefore it is important that organisations consider the options of using a VR fleet management system to streamline this process e.g. if headset numbers are 10 or more or if there is limited IT support within the organisation.*
