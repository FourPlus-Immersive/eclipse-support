# Equipment & Hardware Set Up

## Device applicability

- FourPlus currently offers 3 applications to be experienced on VR and PC. All are currently compatible with Meta Quest 2, 3 and Pro devices. 
- Proteus is a free application so does not require payment or a licence to access. 
- For additional guidance on installing paid, licensed applications like Eclipse Creator VR to headset, click [here](installation-of-eclipse-creator-vr.md). 
- For additional guidance on installing paid, licensed application Eclipse Creator Desktop (coupled with Eclipse Creator VR app) click [here](installation-of-eclipse-creator-desktop.md).

## FourPlus on Meta Quest

The supported platform for the use of FourPlus software is using Meta Horizon Store. The installation guidance here will therefore refer solely to installation using this platform. 

## VR fleet management systems

Although downloading through the Meta Store is ideal for individual headsets and possible for small collections of headsets, users will require a unique account per headset to play the app simultaneously. ArborXR is an alternative for those who wish to install and experience the app on many headsets simultaneously, without using unique accounts.

- Using an MDM like ArborXR allows you to install Eclipse Creator VR (and any other ones you may be using) remotely on a collection of devices. If you choose to use ArborXR and would like to be added to the FourPlus licence distribution list, please contact sales for further details.

*Note: When downloading Eclipse Creator from the Meta Horizon app store and installing to multiple headsets, users should be aware that multiple emails and linked accounts will be required for this (1 per headset). Therefore, it is important that organisations consider the options of using a VR fleet management system to streamline this process e.g. if headset numbers are 10 or more or if there is limited IT support within the organisation.*
