# Eclipse Creator VR Installation

## Set up of new VR headsets (Meta Quest)

- Unbox the headset and controllers.
- Following this, gently pull the plastic blocker tabs from the controller.
- Charge headsets and replace batteries in controllers if required.  
- Put the headset on, adjusting head fittings using the tightening wheel (back) and head strap (top) for comfort and safety as required. 
- Press and hold the button on the left side of the headset for approx. three seconds. This will turn the headset on. 
- Perform any system updates prompted by the headset by following the on-screen instructions.
- Follow any required steps for account set up.

**There is more help and information for setting up your headset [here](equipment-and-hardware-setup.md).**

## Set up of Network connection

*During this phase, you will be met by a request to connect to the internet. This is not easily done when using a locked network such as Eduroam; thus, is it recommended to perform the initial set up on a less restricted (but trusted) network, such as a home network.*

- To connect to a new network, click on Wi-Fi and select it under the Wi-Fi menu on the headset. 
- Once an internet connection has been established, the headsets will update.
- Wait for updates to download and install and do not interrupt this process.
- Once set up, you can enter/exit passthrough mode by tapping on the side of the headset twice.

>We recommend operating with passthrough enabled to perform software installations. This allows a view of a laptop screen and licence code without the need to constantly remove and replace the headset, which can be uncomfortable/time-consuming.

## Adding Eclipse Creator to your library

Below is a guide for the installation of the Eclipse Creator app to Meta headset. First, you must add Eclipse Creator to your Meta account or Meta organisation.

### Finding Eclipse Creator in the headset

## App updates

Eclipse Creator will automatically receive updates through the Meta Horizon platform. If there is an update, you will be prompted to install it when launching the app. There is no requirement to manually manage app updates.

## Network

Eclipse Creator requires an active internet connection to be launched. If you do not have an active connection, the app launch will be prevented. Ensure you are connected to a network to use Eclipse Creator.

## Entering your licence key

Access to content will be limited until customers have been supplied with their licence key. However, there is a FREE demo that can be accessed prior to this. To gain full access to the full content, you will need to enter your Eclipse Creator licence key in the app. This key will be assigned personally and is unique to your institution, so it must not be shared.  When inputting this key while wearing the VR headsets, it is advised to first copy the key into a blank Word document. For ease of reading, you should size to 24+ font and insert dashes every fifth digit (e.g. XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX). If you are not operating in passthrough mode, switch pass through on via the settings menu. Now you should be able to see your laptop screen and no longer need to remove/replace the headset to read the licence key.

- Once the licence has been accepted, you will be able to run the app. If the network set up has been performed correctly, the SOPs loaded into the Eclipse Creator desktop app should reflect those loaded in the headset app and automatically sync.
