# Eclipse Creator VR Installation

## Set up of new VR headsets (Meta Quest)

*This step is best performed at home or on a private unrestricted network rather than a public network (university campus, school or college network).*

- Unbox the headset and controllers.
- Following this, gently pull the plastic blocker tabs from the controller.
- Charge headsets and replace batteries in controllers if required.  
- Afterwards, put the headset on, adjusting head fittings using the tightening wheel (back) and head strap (top) for comfort and safety as required. 
- Then press the button on the left side of the headset, holding down for approx. three seconds. This will turn the headsets on. 
- Perform any system updates prompted by the headset by following the on-screen instructions.  

**There is more help and information for setting up your headset [here](/installation/equipment-and-hardware-set-up/index.md).**

## Set up of Network connection for VR app installation

*During this phase, you will be met by a request to connect to the internet. This is not easily done when using a locked network such as Eduroam; thus, is it recommended to perform the initial set up on a less restricted (but trusted) network, such as a home network.*

- To connect to a new network, click on Wi-Fi and select it under the Wi-Fi menu on the headset. 
- Once an internet connection has been established, the headsets will update.
- Once complete, you can set up you user profiles and begin using the headsets normally.
- Connect the headsets to the Meta Quest app on your phone, using the in-VR instructions. 
- Once set up, you can enter/disable passthrough mode by tapping on the side of the headset twice. You want to enable passthrough mode so that you can see your surroundings upon app installation.

*We recommend operating with passthrough mode on to perform software installations. This allows a view of a laptop screen and license code without the need to constantly remove and replace the headset, which can be uncomfortable/time consuming.*

## Eclipse Creator VR installation to headset

Below is a guide for the installation of the Eclipse Creator app to Meta headset.

*Ensure you have access to your Meta account-associated email and find the emails from FourPlus which give you your license keys. Once you have received your license keys you can access the full version of the VR app from the Meta Horizon app store.*

- Switch on the Meta headset and navigate your way to the account login screen. Then login or create an account here:

## Eclipse Creator VR installation using the license key

*Access to content will be limited until customers have been supplied with their license key. However there is a FREE demo that can be accessed prior to this. To gain full access to the full content, you will need to enter your Eclipse Creator license key in the app. This key will be assigned personally and is unique to your institution, so it must not be shared.  When inputting this key while wearing the VR headsets, it is advised to first copy the key into a blank word document. For ease of reading you should size to 24+ font and insert dashes every fifth digit (e.g. XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX). If you are not operating in passthrough mode, switch pass through on via the settings menu. Now you should be able to see your laptop screen and no longer need to remove/replace the headset to read the license key.*

- Once the license has been accepted, you will be able to run the app. If the network set up has been performed correctly, the SOPs loaded into the Eclipse Creator desktop app should reflect those loaded in the headset app and automatically sync.
